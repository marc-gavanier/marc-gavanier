# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Marc Gavanier

## About

I am a freelance software engineer, passionate developer and specialized in the creation of complex web applications.
I work on both the back-end and the front-end and I strive to apply the most demanding software design standards:

- ðŸ‘¤ Respectful with users by putting their business logic at the core of software design with **Domain Driven Design**
- âœ¨ Maintainability, by writing code for the next developers leaving them *Clean Code* in a **Clean Architecture**
- ðŸš€ Code optimization and blazing production speed with test-driven development **TDD**
- ðŸŽ‰ High delivery frequency and automated deployment to the cloud with **DevOps**
